<h2>CS-255 System Analysis and Design</h2>

<p>This is a repository for all projects related to my CS 255 course at SNHU. This course focuses on the software development process from the business side, staring with collecting requirements from a client to developing use-case, action, and class diagrams.</p>

<h3>Official Course Description</h3>
<p>Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.</p> 

<h3>Project One</h3>
<p>Collect requirements from the DriverPass client. Identify and analyze these requirements in a business requirements document and a model application short paper. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:<ul><li>Explain the principles, methods, and 
techniques of systems development</li></ul> </p>



<h3>Project Two</h3>
<p>Create a system design document for the DriverPass system based on the requirements you collected. Then create a presentation describing your system design. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies: 
  <ul>
    <li>Create various system models through the application of appropriate tools</li>
    <li>Present and articulate technical concepts to non-technical audiences</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Final Reflections and Questions</h3>

<p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</li>
    <ul><li><em>This project revolved around creating an application for the fictional company "DriverPass". DriverPass is a driver's education school that provides students with videos, practice tests, real-world driving experience, and prepares them for the DMV driving test. Their online application would act as a hub where students can access all of these things in one place.</em></li></ul>
    <li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
    <ul><li><em>The whole project had me taking on multiple roles and responsibilites, and it's hard to pinpoint one in particular that I thought I did well. This is mainly because I feel like a did all parts well, and did not have any major issues with anything moving through. This is not a cop-out answer, either; I know where I need to improve, and I know where my work met or exceeded standards. This project was an example of the latter, from start to finish.</em></li></ul>
    <li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</li>
    <ul><li><em>The only place of this project I would like more *time* to learn about (not necessarily because my submission was insufficient, mind you) would be the UML class diagram. I know that there are many different ways to represent the various design ideas I had during this project; I would like the opportunity to see more of them, and compare and contrast their properties.</em></li></ul>
    <li>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</li>
    <ul><li><em>I mean, why wouldn't you consider the user's needs when designing their system? If you design a system and don't consider the needs of the user who will be using the system, then your system is bound to fail in one way or another. If a user cannot intuitively access your system's features, then you've designed a bad system.</em></li></ul>
    <li>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</li>
    <ul><li><em>When I am designing a system, I think about how I personally would like to interact with it, what I would like to see that system do. Taking on the role of the potential user is second nature to me. I have seen many good interfaces and just as many bad, and I do have a bit of a mind for design. Additionally, from a programmer's standpoint, I am organized and logical, and I want my designed system to reflect that.</em></li></ul>
