<h2>CS-255 System Analysis and Design</h2>

<p>This is a repository for all projects related to my CS 255 course at SNHU. This course focuses on the software development process from the business side, staring with collecting requirements from a client to developing use-case, action, and class diagrams.</p>

<h3>Official Course Description</h3>
<p>Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.</p> 

<h3>Project One</h3>
<p>Collect requirements from the DriverPass client. Identify and analyze these requirements in a business requirements document and a model application short paper. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:<ul><li>Explain the principles, methods, and 
techniques of systems development</li></ul> </p>

<h3>Project Two</h3>
<p>Create a system design document for the DriverPass system based on the requirements you collected. Then create a presentation describing your system design. In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competencies: 
  <ul>
    <li>Create various system models through the application of appropriate tools</li>
    <li>Present and articulate technical concepts to non-technical audiences</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h3>Final Reflections and Questions</h3>

<p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</li>
    <li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</li>
    <li>What did you do particularly well?</li>
    <li>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</li>
    <li>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</li>
    <li>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</li>
